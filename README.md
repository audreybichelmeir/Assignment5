Problems:
the program is faulty because when running it, the menu file it sometimes gives the user the ability to type in their menu choice and sometimes just breaks/runs right away. Therefore, it was a challenging to continue because the main menu does not work.

when the user types in a letter rather than a number it causes an error and runs the main menu but it just breaks the menu option.
